# Scill Unreal Plugin

Our Unreal Plugin offers easy access to the Scill HTTP API for simple requests and to the Scill MQTT Server for real-time updates. These functions enable access to the API from the Unreal Blueprint System. While you can also access these functions from C++ code of your plugin, this documentation focuses on Blueprints. Simply transfer the usage to C++ code (which should be trivial most of the times). The Plugin offers Components and Interfaces that are best added to your Game Mode, Player Controller and Game Instance.

Since this Plugin is completely open source you are welcomed to adjust them to your own needs, extending or changing the classes.

## Source Code

You can find the source code to our Unreal Plugin in our public Github repository: https://github.com/scillgame/scill-unreal. If you encounter any bugs or issues with the Plugin, please let us know in the Issues tab of Github.

If you fix a bug in our code base, please commit your bugfix in a separate branch and create a merge request with a short description what you have fixed. Of course, we will credit you and your game in the changelog and at the start page of our Github repository in this case!

## Installing the Plugin

Installation of the Plugin is fairly easy. Just download the source from our Github repository and copy the content into the `Plugins/ScillSDK` subdirectory of your Project. If not yet present, create any folder needed.

After that you normally only have to open the project and start working. It might be necessary to enable the Plugin under `Edit->Plugins` in the Unreal Editor's menu bar.

You should not need to compile the source code. If this is not the case you will have to install Visual Studio with the correct workflow modules - refer to Epic Game's documentation about that for more details: https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/VisualStudioSetup/index.html.

## Notes about Working with the Plugin

In order to properly work with this plugin and also ensure security in your game you most likely want to be familiar with the concept of [Game Modes](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Framework/GameMode/index.html), [Player Controllers](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Framework/Controller/PlayerController/index.html), [Pawns](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Framework/Pawn/index.html), [Game Instances](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Framework/GameFlow/index.html) and, for multiplayer games, [Networking](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Networking/index.html).

Besides these basic concepts in the Unreal Engine also make yourself familiar with the work-wise of the Scill API - this section assumes you have basic knowledge of the API, for a good starting point visit the [Scill Guides](https://developers.scillgame.com/guides/guides-overview.html).

## Working with Blueprints

To access this SDK via blueprints please refer to the [Blueprint Documentation](/Documentation/Blueprints.md).
